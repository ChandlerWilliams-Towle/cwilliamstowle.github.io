<h3>Estimating Costs</h3>

	<p>How we come to figure out the overall price of a project is simple. We will first come to the location or site of the project with our client to review it for safety concerns and check with the client on their budget. This is critical to make sure we don't make a grandiose project outside of their price range. We then consult with our expert engineers to find materials that give the client the project they want, all within costs. We finalize this with a bid sent to the client for them to check and give the okay to start work.</p>
